Welcome, and thank you for your interest in helping us be *the* home for 3D printing documentation.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Edits can be proposed via Pull Request on GitHub. Click the "Edit page" link on the bottom of any
page to get started!

By submitting a PR, you agree that all content on this wiki is licensed under GPLv3.
This means that anyone is free to use the content on this wiki, provided they make
any modifications available under the same license. We want everyone to be able to benefit.

## AI Policy

This policy is not designed to be comprehensive, but merely to provide a set of guidelines when considering
appropriate use of AI when contributing to this wiki.

The key point in all of this: **remember the human**. Usage of AI tools should be thoughtful, nuanced, and
with a human fully in the loop. Additionally, please disclose any AI usage when submitting contributions.

Some examples of acceptable AI use include:

- Having an LLM proofread your changes for clarity.
- Use an AI-powered translation tool, especially if English is not your first language.
- Helping expand on an outline that you've written.

We want the content here to be human generated. If you're just prompting an LLM to write a new page from scratch,
that sort of contribution is not welcome -- after all, anybody can go ask ChatGPT the same question and get the
same possibly questionable answer.

If you need clarification or have a specific question on this, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bjschafer/3dprinting-wiki/issues)
and ask. We want to make the best content we can.

And when in doubt, share what you've done. If you take these guidelines to heart, you're probably fine.
