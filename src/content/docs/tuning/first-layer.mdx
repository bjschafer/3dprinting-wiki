## Too high

![Support base that was printed too high. You can see gaps between the lines](./first-layer/too-high.png)

This print was about 0.110mm too high on the tree support base that's in focus. Look at the gaps between
lines -- this indicates there's not enough smush.

Also note that this is a textured build plate. Those usually want another few hundreths of a millimeter more smush
than smooth plates, but are also a bit more tolerant of imperfect first layer smush.
