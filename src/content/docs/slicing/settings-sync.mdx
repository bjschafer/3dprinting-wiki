import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import setupNix from "./settings-sync/setup.sh?raw";
import setupWin from "./settings-sync/setup.ps1?raw";
import newMachineNix from "./settings-sync/new-machine.sh?raw";
import newMachineWin from "./settings-sync/new-machine.ps1?raw";

Do you have multiple computers you'd like to run your slicer on but don't want to manually keep your settings
in sync? This is for you!

These direction are written for OrcaSlicer as that's what I regularly use, but should be adaptible between
other slicers.

## Cloud sync

Some slicers (e.g. Bambu and OrcaSlicer) include a network / cloud plugin you can enable to sync your settings between computers.
This is often the most straightforward way.

## External sync

If you can easily do so, you can make a shortcut to pass the correct option for your slicer. For OrcaSlicer, this would look like
`/path/to/orcaslicer --datadir PATH_TO_YOUR_SYNC`. This can be done in the KDE menu editor, or easily via a shortcut on Windows. It's somewhat
more obnoxious to do on macOS.

If you'd prefer something a bit more granular, you can use the below approach that creates symlinks to your config.

### Initial setup

First off, you need something to physically do the sync. Options include:

- Dropbox
- Syncthing
- Git repository (my preferred method -- less automatic but lets you version your changes)

Set up one of these on the computer you're starting out with.

Then, you'll need to run the following. Choose PowerShell if you're on Windows, and Bash if you're on
macOS or Linux:

<Tabs syncKey="shell">
  <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
    <Code code={setupNix} lang="bash" title="setup.sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
    <Code code={setupWin} lang="powershell" title="setup.ps1" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Setting up additional/new machines

Once you've set up your source of truth, you can set up additional machines like so:

<Tabs syncKey="shell">
  <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
    <Code code={newMachineNix} lang="bash" title="new-machine.sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
    <Code code={newMachineWin} lang="powershell" title="new-machine.ps1" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
