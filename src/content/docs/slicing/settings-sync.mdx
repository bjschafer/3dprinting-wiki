import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import setupNix from "./settings-sync/setup-nix.sh?raw";
import setupWin from "./settings-sync/setup-win.ps1?raw";

Do you have multiple computers you'd like to run your slicer on but don't want to manually keep your settings
in sync? This is for you!

These direction are written for OrcaSlicer as that's what I regularly use, but should be adaptible between
other slicers.

## Initial setup

First off, you need something to physically do the sync. Options include:

- Dropbox
- Syncthing
- Git repository (my preferred method -- less automatic but lets you version your changes)

Set up one of these on the computer you're starting out with.

Then, you'll need to run the following. Choose PowerShell if you're on Windows, and Bash if you're on
macOS or Linux:

<Tabs syncKey="shell">
  <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
    <Code code={setupNix} lang="bash" title="setup-nix.sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
    <Code code={setupWin} lang="powershell" title="setup-nix.sh" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setting up additional/new machines

Once you've set up your source of truth, you can set up additional machines like so:

<Tabs syncKey="shell">
  <TabItem label="Bash" icon="seti:shell">
    Under construction -- check back in a day or two!
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="PowerShell" icon="seti:powershell">
    Under construction -- check back in a day or two!
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
